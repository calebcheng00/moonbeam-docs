# Roadmap

Moonbeam is still being actively developed. 

On September 2020, we launched our [TestNet](/networks/overview/). Since then we have performed significants upgrades on almost a monthly basis. You can check the milestones achieved by each update in their corresponding [release notes](/networks/testnet/#release-notes).


The rough roadmap beyond that is to launch Moonriver, our Kusama deployment, by the end of Q1 2021, and Moonbeam on the Polkadot MainNet in Q2 2021.

Our current focus is to make sure the Moonbeam EVM and Web3 compatibility features are feature-complete. A big part of this effort was completing the Web3 grant we received to implement a Web3-compatible RPC API. Details of the grant can be found [here](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/web3-compatible-api.md).  The work we did for this grant was completed and [approved in August 2020](https://www.purestake.com/news/purestake-awarded-web3-foundation-grant-moonbeam/).
