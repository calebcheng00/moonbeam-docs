# The Graph

## Introduction

The Graph is a decentralized and open-source indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. In short, it provides a way to efficiently store data emitted by events from smart contracts so that other projects or dApps can access it easily. Thanks to Moonbeams Ethereum compatibility features, including support of Ethereum tracing modules, The Graph can be used to index blockchain data on Moonbeam.

## Run a Graph Node

You can run a Graph node against a locally running Moonbeam development node or a full Moonbase Alpha node. To learn how to run a Graph Node against Moonbeam, check out the [Run a Graph Node against Moonbase Alpha](/node-operators/indexer-nodes/graph-node/) page of our documentation. These instructions can be adapted to be used with a Moonbeam development node. 

## Step-by-step Tutorials
