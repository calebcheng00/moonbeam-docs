# Waffle

![Waffle Introduction](/images/waffle-mars/waffle-banner.png)
## Introduction

[Waffle](https://www.getwaffle.io/) is a popular development framework for testing Solidity smart contracts. Since Moonbeam is Ethereum compatible, with a few lines of extra configuration, you can use Waffle as you normally would with Ethereum to develop on Moonbeam.

## Configure Waffle to Connect to Moonbeam

Assuming you already have a JavaScript or TypeScript project, install Waffle:

```
npm install ethereum-waffle
```

To configure Waffle to run tests against a Moonbeam development node or the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, within your tests create a custom provider and add network configurations:

```typescript
describe ('Test Contract', () => {
  // Use custom provider to connect to Moonbase Alpha or Moonbeam development node
  const moonbaseAlphaProvider: Provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.testnet.moonbeam.network');
  const devProvider: Provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:9933');
})
```
