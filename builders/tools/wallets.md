# Wallets

![Wallets Introduction](/images/wallets/wallets-banner.png)

## Introduction

Moonbeam's underlying [account system](/learn/features/unified-accounts/) allows users to interact with Moonbeam using a single Ethereum-style (H160) address. To create or interact with an account on Moonbeam, check out one of the Moonbeam compatible wallets: [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [MathWallet](https://mathwallet.org/), [Polkadot JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/), and [AirGap](https://airgap.it/).

## Moonbeam Compatible Wallets

- MetaMask - A crypto wallet and Ethereum Provider API that allows users to manage accounts via a mobile app, browser extension, hardware wallet, and more.
- MathWallet - A universal crypto wallet that is compatible with MetaMask's Ethereum Provider API and available in the form of a mobile app, browser extension, web wallet, and hardware wallet.
- Polkadot JS Apps - Polkadot JS is rooted in Polkadot but was adapted to natively support H160 addresses and therefore can be used to manage Moonbeam accounts.
- AirGap - A hardware wallet that uses a two device approach to store your private keys safely offline.

## Connect MetaMask to Moonbase Alpha

If you already have [MetaMask installed](https://metamask.io/download.html), you can easily connect MetaMask to the Moonbase Alpha test network:
