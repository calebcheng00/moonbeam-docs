# Mars

## Introduction

[Mars](https://github.com/EthWorks/Mars) is a new infrastructure-as-code tool for deploying Solidity smart contracts. Mars makes writing advanced deployment scripts a breeze and handles state change for you, making sure your deployments are always up-to-date. Since Moonbeam is Ethereum compatible, you can use Mars as you normally would with Ethereum to develop on Moonbeam. All you have to do is change the network you wish to deploy to. 

## Configure Mars to Connect to Moonbeam

Assuming you already have a JavaScript or TypeScript project, install Mars:

```
npm install ethereum-mars
```

To configure Mars to deploy to a Moonbeam development node or the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, within your deployment scripts add the following network configurations:

```typescript
import { deploy } from 'ethereum-mars';

const privateKey = "<insert-your-private-key-here>";

// For Moonbeam development node
deploy({network: 'http://localhost:9933', privateKey},(deployer) => {
  // Deployment logic will go here
});

// For Moonbase Alpha
deploy({network: 'https://rpc.testnet.moonbeam.network', privateKey},(deployer) => {
  // Deployment logic will go here
});

```
